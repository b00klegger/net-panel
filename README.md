This Gnome panel icon displays the internet connection status (connected or not).

It is only required when you expect the internet connection to be broken at a point beyond the computer itself.

See [this stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6094506/simple-gnome-panel-applet-in-python) for an example of such a breakage point and [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6094506/simple-gnome-panel-applet-in-python/6188423#6188423) for [the app](http://gitorious.org/tomate/) that formed the starting point for this project.
